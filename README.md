# E-Shop
Ecommerce site (Frontend)

I created an e-commerce site for an online shop using Vanilla Javascript. Items can be added to cart, increased or decreased and the total price obtained. This is the fronted portion of the store and has some scroll animation. I'm hoping to add a checkout page and user login later on in the backend
